 * I found this function necessary when converting a double of say

 * printed but if you specified a precision of %.2f in printf i.e 2 digits
 * after the decimal point you get 100.00 and not 99.99 If you increase
 * the precision to %.10f then you get 99.9999999999 but I only want
 * two significant digits displayed.i.e 99.99% not 100%
 * So this function converts to double retaining sufficient precision
 * so that a 30TB disc with one hidden sector will display as 99.99% erased
 * As an example if the double value to be converted is 99.999999999999999987
 * this function will always output 99.99 unlike printf which outputs 100.00
 * @param char* pointer to the string we write our percentage to. Needs to be
 * a minimum of 7 bytes, i.e 100.00 plus null terminator.
 * @param double the floating point value to be converted to a string.
 * @return void
